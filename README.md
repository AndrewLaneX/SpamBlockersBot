## Setup

1. Clone the Git repository to your machine then install dependencies.

3. Make a `admins.json` file with an array of Telegram user IDs of admins you want to use admin-only commands.
4. Finally, fire up the console and type `npm start` to hit the road.
5. Optionally, [set up also](https://docs.spamblockers.bot/api-docs/setup) the API server.
